## Basics: 

it or test: describes the test itself. It takes as parameters the name of the test and a function that holds the tests.

expect: the condition that the test needs to pass. It will compare the received parameter to a matcher.

a matcher: a function that is applied to the expected condition.

render: the method used to render a given component.
